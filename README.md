This is the source code to my personal site, [roman.nurik.net](http://roman.nurik.net) and [design portfolio](http://roman.nurik.net/portfolio/).

The site was built starting with the [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit/),
and uses [Swig](http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). To build the site (which gets output in the `dist` directory), just run

    npm install
    gulp
